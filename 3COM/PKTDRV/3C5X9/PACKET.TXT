                     EtherDisk (R) Diskette for
                 The 3C5X9 EtherLink III NIC Family
                      Clarkson Packet Driver



The EtherLink III family of NICs are all software configured.
When the packet driver is loaded the only required command line
parameter is the software interrupt value `PKT_INT_NUM.'  This
software interrupt is used for communication between the driver and
the protocol and should not be confused with the NIC's hardware
interrupt.  As of version 1.09 of the Packet Driver Specification
valid software interrupt values are in the range 0x60 to 0x80.

The SLOT and IOBASE parameters are to be used only when there is
more than one EtherLink III board in the machine.  This parameter
indicates to the packet driver which NIC to use.  For NICs in ISA mode,
use the IOBASE parameter.  On Microchannel NICs, EISA NICs, or ISA NICs
in EISA mode, use the SLOT parameter.
You cannot use both IOBASE and SLOT on the same command line.

EXAMPLE:  You have two EtherLink III ISA NICs in your machine.
One is installed at I/O Base 300 hex and the other at 320 hex.  To
use the card located at 300 hex and load it at software interrupt
60 hex for use in a Windows environment, use the command line:

        3C5X9PD -w 0x60 IOBASE=0x300

For a complete usage summary, enter 3C5X9PD at the DOS command prompt.
